# Admission Chance Calculator

A simple Linear Regeression model based project with [live link](https://share.streamlit.io/robby11baidwan/project_1/main/Proj1.py) that helps in calculating the probability of getting admission in a University of specified ranking.

## Description

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions)  contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs.

The parameters included are :  

GRE Scores ( out of 340 ) 

TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 ) 

University Rating ( out of 5 ) 

Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 ) 

Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 ) 

Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 ) 

Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 ) 


### Use the visualization tool provided to compare attributes present in the dataset.
